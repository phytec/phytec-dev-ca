Dependencies
------------
phytec-dev-ca is a development CA created with the tool
[XCA](https://hohnstaedt.de/xca).

The password for the database is set to `phytec-dev-ca`.

The keys for NXP's HAB v4 and AHAB were created using the scripts provided in
NXP's Code Signing Tool:
[gitlab.apertis.org/pkg/imx-code-signing-tool](https://gitlab.apertis.org/pkg/imx-code-signing-tool/-/tree/debian/unstable)

Certificate Hierarchy
---------------------

* `main-ca`: PHYTEC-ROOT is a self signed certificate with RSA-4096
  * `nxp_ahab_pki`: NXP keys for AHAB secure boot with NIST P-521 (secp521r1)
    * bootloader/boot container: for i.MX93
    * Super root keys (SRK) 1, 2, 3 and 4
    * Certificates for SRKs signed by PHYTEC Root CA
  * `nxp_habv4_pki`:  NXP Keys for HABV4 (SRK 1..4) secure boot with RSA-4096
    * bootloader/boot container: for i.MX6, i.MX6UL, i.MX8M (MNP)
    * fitImage: with u-boot for i.MX8M (MNP)
    * CSF
